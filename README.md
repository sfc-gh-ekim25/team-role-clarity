# Role Clarity Agent

AI-native product development role clarity framework based on Design Manager offsite findings and CEO manifesto.

## Usage

```bash
cd team-role-clarity
cortex
```

Then run:
```
/role-clarity <your question>
```

## Example Questions

- "What did we learn from the pilot teams?"
- "What's the difference between platform clarity and role clarity?"
- "When should we build UI vs CLI/AI?"
- "What are the new roles for design?"
- "How do we enable decision-making with AI?"

## Contents

- `.cortex/commands/role-clarity.md` — The agent command
- `.cortex/memory/ai-native-product-development-manifesto.md` — CEO manifesto context
- `.cortex/memory/snowsight-ux-strategy-fy27.md` — FY27 UX strategy context

## Key Frameworks

1. **Platform Clarity > Role Clarity** — Most slowdowns are system knowledge gaps, not ownership conflicts
2. **High vs Low Leverage Work** — AI absorbs low-leverage execution, humans own judgment
3. **Open-ended → Deterministic Spectrum** — Start with agentic workflows, move to UI with user feedback
4. **6 Core Questions** — Can I trust this? What just happened? What's connected? What will it cost? What breaks? What's next?
