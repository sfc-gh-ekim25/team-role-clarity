- This strategy is the "what" — the manifesto is the "how"

## Vision
Unbundle Snowsight into 3 connected products optimized for distinct users:
1. **Practitioner Workspace** - Active work (querying, troubleshooting, decisions)
2. **Admin Experience** - Platform oversight (cost, governance, security)
3. **Snowflake Intelligence** - Business user consumption (answers without complexity)

## Core Philosophy: 6 Questions Users Need Answered
1. Can I trust this?
2. What just happened?
3. What is this connected to?
4. What will this cost me?
5. What breaks if I change this?
6. What should I do next?

## 10 Critical Moments (Priority Order)
1. Querying data (write, run, iterate)
2. Understanding & trusting query results
3. Exploring data objects (tables, views, columns)
4. Troubleshooting failures & errors
5. Understanding cost & performance impact
6. Assessing impact before making changes
7. Getting started & orienting in Snowsight
8. Pausing, resuming, managing workstreams
9. Sharing results & enabling consumers
10. Platform setup, governance, admin oversight

## Current State Assessment
- 🟢 Green: Query execution, error feedback
- 🟡 Yellow: Trust signals, lineage visibility
- 🔴 Red: Cost correlation, impact preview, guidance/next actions

## Key UX Requirements
- In-flow by default (no context switching)
- Action-ready experiences (no dead ends)
- Consistent object data across products
- Conversational search as universal workflow
- AI explains "why" and suggests "what next"
